Here you can find my programming tasks which I made during the course "Python 3 from Basics to Expert".
In file "zadania_udemy.ipynb" you will find the simple tasks where I used lists, tuples, dictionaries etc. to 
solve my tasks. I learnt how to use many usefull functions for example shuffle(), Counter(), choices(), random() and
many more. In file "czytanie_innych_plikow.ipynb" I learnt how to read or write files from Computer.
In file "JSON.ipynb" I learnt how to write and read the JSON data. I also got to know how request.get() work.
In file "publiczne API" I learnt about publics APIs and how to get informations form it. I also learnt about 
webbrowser.open_new_tab() function which give me opportunity to open links in browser. All other files are used to
read or write files.
