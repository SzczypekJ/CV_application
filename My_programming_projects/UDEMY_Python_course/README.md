Here you can find my programming tasks which I made during the course "Python 3 from Basics to Expert".
In file "zadania_udemy.ipynb" you will find the simple tasks where I used lists, tuples, dictionaries etc. to 
solve my tasks. I learnt how to use many usefull functions for example shuffle(), Counter(), choices(), random() and
many more. In file "czytanie_innych_plikow.ipynb" I learnt how to read or write files from Computer.
In file "JSON.ipynb" I learnt how to write and read the JSON data. I also got to know how request.get() work.
In file "publiczne API" I learnt about publics APIs and how to get, post and delete informations from API. I also learnt about 
webbrowser.open_new_tab() function which give me opportunity to open links in browser. In file "generating_functions.ipynb" 
I learnt about generated functions where I got to know how next() function or "yield" works. In the "programowanie_obiektowe" folder
you can find some task from object oriented programming. I learn there how some dunder methods works. I learnt 
about inheritance, aggregation and assignment. I learnt how to program simple task using class. Most of the 
python files are interconnected for example: "bankaccount2.py" and "my_script_for_bankaccount2.py". All other files are used to
read or write files.
