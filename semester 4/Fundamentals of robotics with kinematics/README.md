Here you can find my works form subject "Fundamentals of robotics with kinematics". On this subject I learnt how to programm simple controller for robot.
This robots are: FANUC, Epson, Khepper, SCARA, e.t.c. We mostly used to programm in "Matlab" but I had also gain basic kwonledge of Dspace, Roboguide controller,
EPSON RC+.
