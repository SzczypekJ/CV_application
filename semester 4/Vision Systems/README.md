Here you can find my works from subject which name is "Vision Systems". There are two folders here, first contains my reports which I had to do for this subcject, 
the second contains my homework,  which was an opportunity to get a better grade. I programmed in Python on this subject using a lot of useful libraries. 
I used this libraries to implement basic visual algorithms. I could learn more how to program in Python.
Also I have learnt a lot about libraries in python and how to use them in practice.
