Here you can find my works and report from subcject "Identification of Technological Processes".
During this laboratories I had to carrying out the identification system consisting of three liquid tanks,
level sensors and a pump. This taks required intermedate steps:
- Rescaling liquid level sensors
- Delineation of the liquid flow characteristics depending on the pump control value
- Finding model coefficients for individual tanks
- Determination of the state matrix to determine the transfer function of the system
- Implementacja regulatora LQR wraz z doborem jego nastaw


The final goal of the project is stabilization with the built-in constant level regulator
liquid in the third tank. All the project was made in "Matlab" and "Simulink".
