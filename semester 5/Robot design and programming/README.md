Here you can find my works form subject "Robot design and programming". On this laboratory I programmed two robot controllers for IRP6 and SCARA.
I programmed in "Matlab/Simulink". The controller contains simple kinematics, inverse kinematics, homing, manual mode and triggered mode.
After programmed the controller I had to make interface in program "Dspace". I also programmed in "Roboguide" to make controller for SCARA robot. 
Here I had to build robot workspace and after that I programmed robot to transferring packages from the pallet to the conveyor belt.
