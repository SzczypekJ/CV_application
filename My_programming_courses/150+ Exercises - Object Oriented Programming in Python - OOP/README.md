Here you can find my programming tasks which I made during the "150+ Exercises - Object Oriented Programming in Python - OOP" course.
Through these tasks I was able to increase my programming, analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. 
Through these assignments, I have expanded my knowledge of object-oriented programming and the range of different aspects involved. 
These assignments also confirm my knowledge of the Python language and object-oriented programming in this language itself.
