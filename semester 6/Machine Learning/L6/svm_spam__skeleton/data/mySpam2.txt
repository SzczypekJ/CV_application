Hi Jakub,


Thank you for all your effort put into completing Codility tasks and answering my video question! I know that it is not comfortable to sit in front of a camera and record such a video :) 

We’ve tested your codility solutions and reviewed your application very carefully. It was a daunting task to choose top applicants among so many prospective candidates, but we’ve managed to come up with a final decision. Unfortunately, you didn’t make it to the next step 🙁. I’m really sorry to break such bad news to you, but I hope it was still a valuable experience.

Given the large number of candidates, we’re not able to share detailed feedback with everyone at this stage. However, if you’d like to share your feedback on this recruitment process, feel free to do so and we will take it into consideration while preparing for the next internships edition. 

So again, thank you for taking the time to apply and your interest in joining u2i. We encourage you to keep learning and we wish you all the best! Hopefully, our career paths will cross again in the future!

Best
Weronika
