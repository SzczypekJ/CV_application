Here you can find my works from subject which name is "Analysis and Databases". I programmed in Python on this subject using a lot of useful libraries, for example:
scikit-learn or pandas. I used this libraries to solve create databases and modify them. I could learn more how to program in Python.
Also I have learnt a lot about libraries in python and how to use them in practice.
