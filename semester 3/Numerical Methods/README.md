Here you can find my works from subject which name is "Numerical Methods". I programmed in Python on this subject using a lot of useful libraries. 
I used this libraries to solve some numerical problems and to program some numerical algorithms. I could learn more how to program in Python.
Also I have learnt a lot about libraries in python and how to use them in practice.
