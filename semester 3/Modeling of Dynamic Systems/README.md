Here you can find my works from subject which name is "Modeling of Dynamic Systems". I programmed in Matlab on this subject. I have also used Simulink.
On this subject I programmed some dynamic systems models. Also I had to programmed important algorithms which gave me opportunity to learn more about
how Matlab works. I could also learn more about Matlab tool which name is Simulink. With Silumink we can made simple and more 
advanced simulations and dynamic model systems.
